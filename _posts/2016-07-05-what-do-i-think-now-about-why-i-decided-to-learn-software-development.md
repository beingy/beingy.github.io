[Back in May](http://beingy.github.io/blog/why-did-i-decide-to-learn-software-development/), I wrote my very first thoughts on why I decided to learn software development.  Back then I was inpatient, I was eager to get started and I have already wasted too much time not learning and writing about why I am learning felt counterintuitive, unproductive, and frustrating.  On a whim, <!--more--> I wrote about how I wished I didn't have to explain myself... when it was a leap of faith that I took to learn code.  My future was in the air... and I wasn't ready to talk about it until my immediate future start to take form.  The mission was clear and simple.  *Learn and do everything Learn asks of you*.

*Insert free falling image of myself*

*Now in July*, I feel a certain comfort level with coding on a regular basis.  Taking a problem and finding a way or numerous ways to solve it on my own or collaboratively in a team.  Most of all, I now recognize the importance of writing [blogs] and documenting [my learnings] and share them with fellow learners.  I hope in retrospect, this serve as a reminder to myself to keep an open mind and keep learning and writing.
