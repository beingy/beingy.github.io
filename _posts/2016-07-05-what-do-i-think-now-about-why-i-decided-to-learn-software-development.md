[Back in May](#back-in-may), I wrote my very first thoughts on why I decided to learn software development.  Back then I was inpatient, I was eager to get started and I have already wasted too much time not learning and writing about why I am learning felt counterintuitive, unproductive, and frustrated.  Out on a whim, I wrote about how I wish I didn't have to explain myself... when it was a leap of faith that I took to learn code.  My future was now in the air... I wasn't ready to talk about it until my immediate future start to take form.  The mission was clear and simple.  *Learn and do everything Learn asks of you*.

*Insert free falling image of myself*

*Now in July*, I feel a certain comfort level with coding on a regular basis.  Taking a problem and finding a way or numerous ways to solve it on my own or collaboratively in a team.  Most of all, I now recognize the importance of writing [blogs] and documenting [my learnings] and share them with fellow learners.  I hope in retrospect, this serve as a reminder to myself to keep an open mind and keep learning and writing.

## Back in May

Google [reasons to learn software development](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=reasons+to+learn+software+development) and you will get over 75 million results in under half a second.

I wish I didn\'t have to think about the reasons that led me to my decision to learn software development for fear of second-guessing myself or getting side-tracked to day dream about the future.  I have dwelled on this question for weeks and I would rather be learning.

There is no inspirational story to tell; or, an elaborate journey taken to get here. There is just me; and, learning to code one lesson at a time.

Without a doubt, my decision to learn software development was all due to [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/). Getting accepted into the [Learn Verified](http://learn.co/with/beingy) program is like a space ship just offered me a seat for an adventure of a lifetime.  I just know I need to get on and do my best and worry about the rest later.

I hope a later wiser version of me will come back in 7 months and have stories to tell.  Tell me that the hard work was worth every bit of it and more.  Tell me that I have found a job in software development and by the way I am loving it.  Tell me that I was right this *has* changed my life for the better.  Tell me that I am now helping others to learn how to code.  Tell me that I am contributing to the open source community. Tell me that it didn't mattered *why* I decided to learn software development because all it mattered was that I *did*.

*learning, loving, coding*
