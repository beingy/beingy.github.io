title: "Day 3: Getting git! and more HTML!"

Day 3 on a Saturday is tough.  The mind & body wanted to take it easy but somehow the responsible adult in me kept nagging and I got some work.
I'm getting git!  Playing with branches, more git status and commits... even making Project Pages on GitHub (see gh-pages branch, don't forget 'git rebase master').
I'm also enjoying the code along with Jon's videos.  Note to students starting out like me the Google Map iframe embed can be found by clicking the 'Share' icon on the left sliding tab column thingiemajig.  It is no longer in the lower right corner under Setting icon (gone).  Keep up the good work!
