Finally enrolled in the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/)'s [Learn-Verified program](http://learn.co) for Full Stack Web Development. I also want to start a blog to keep track of my progress and learnings.  This simple blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. I have no idea what I'm doing yet.  Just following a step-by-step guide called [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/): A step-by-step beginner's guide to creating a personal website and blog using Jekyll and hosting it for free using GitHub Pages.
