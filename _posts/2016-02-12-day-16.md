Had to take a quick break in the past 2 days.  I have broken my streak again both on Learn and Github which is a shame.  It is time to try harder.  Good news is I'm done with HTML/CSS.  Now getting reacquainted with Ruby.

# Note to self: #

1. Read a chapter a day of Rubyist.  It'll do you some good.
