I think the clearfix hack deserve a post by itself:

    .clearfix:after {
      content: ".";  
      display: block;  
      clear: both;  
      visibility: hidden;  
      height: 0;  
      line-height: 0;  
    }

I am beginning to feel more comfortable deciphering the complex css codes and relaying them to the corresponding html files.  I'm also beginning to realize at least for me, it is good to have a sink-in period.  Let the new materials brew in my mind before I hastily march forward the next lesson.  Hopefully things will sink-in much quicker.
