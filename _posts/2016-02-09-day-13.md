I'm so close to moving on to Ruby but somehow I got fixated onto customizing Atom and zsh command line again.  I'm always curious to figure out all the shortcuts and customizations that are used in the learning videos.

# Note to self: #

1. Please finish Bootstrap lessons tomorrow!
2. Pick up the pace!
