Day 2 was all about git version control.  It is quite amazing how far [GitHub](https://github.com) has come and how widely it is being used nowadays.  I was intimated by it the first time I checked it out years ago but now that we are properly introduced - I'm liking it and now it will be part of everything I do.
Going through the HTML basics and it is a nice refresher course so far.  Nice to be playing with web stuff again.
I think my main challenge at this point in the course is really just sitting down and go through the lessons without interuption or distraction.  I hope to get better at that as my goal is doing at least 8 hours of lessons/assignments a day for the next 3-4 months.
Doing the code alongs, I also need to get more familiar with using a mac.  I've always been a PC user but it has been fairly fun to be doing everything in a similar yet different way.  :)  //<3
