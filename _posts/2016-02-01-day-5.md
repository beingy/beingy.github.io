I like the idea of having a streak... and I broke it on Day 5.  Try again? [Y/n] Y!

Added to Jekyll List of Things to Learn:
1. How do I insert date of last file modified and saved date locally
2. Or, is it better to use the date it was pushed to GitHub - if so how do I add that to my post?
3. Jekyll doesn't use a database, so is it still possible to keep a running tab of my post streak from day to day?
