Google [reasons to learn software development](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=reasons+to+learn+software+development) and you will get over 75 million results in under half a second.

I wish I didn\'t have to think about the reasons that led me to my decision to learn software development for fear of second-guessing myself or getting side-tracked to day dream about the future.  I have dwelled on this question for weeks and I would rather be learning.

There is no inspirational story to tell; or, an elaborate journey taken to get here. There is just me; and, learning to code one lesson at a time.

Without a doubt, my decision to learn software developement was all due to [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/). Getting accepted into the [Learn Verified](learn.co/with/beingy) program is like a space ship just offered me a seat for an adventure of a lifetime.  I just know I need to get on and do my best and worry about the rest later.

I hope a later wiser version of me will come back in 7 months and have stories to tell.  Tell me that the hard work was worth every bit of it and more.  Tell me that I have found a job in software development and by the way I am loving it.  Tell me that I was right this *has* changed my life for the better.  Tell me that I am now helping others to learn how to code.  Tell me that I am contributing to the open source community. Tell me that it didn't mattered *why* I decided to learn software development because all it mattered was that I *did*.

*learning, loving, coding*
