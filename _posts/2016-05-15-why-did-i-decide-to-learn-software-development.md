Google [reasons to learn software development](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=reasons+to+learn+software+development) and you will get over 75 million results in under half a second.

I wish I didn\'t have to think about the reasons that led me to my decision to learn software development. I have dwelled on this question for weeks and I just want to move on and actually focus on learning to code. 

There is no inspirational story to tell; or, an elaborate journey taken to get here. There is just me; and, the hard work that I put into learning to code.

I do want to mention my number one reason on my decision to learn software developement is [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/) and getting into the [Learn Verified](learn.co/with/beingy) program made everything possible. Getting into the Learn Verified program is like a space ship that just offered me a seat for an adventure of a lifetime.  I just know I need to get on and do my best and worry about the rest later.

I hope a later, wiser version of me will come back soon to enlighten my current self who rather be coding than blogging.

*Learn Love Code*
