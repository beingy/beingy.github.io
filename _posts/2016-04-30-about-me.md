I'm a long time computer & gadget enthusiast who has never gone beyond doing anything serious with coding or software development until I realized decades later how much I've been missing out and standing on the sidelines dabbling superficially in technology knowing so little about the magic that makes technology tick.
I crave to create and express myself through the codes I write.  This is my journey to find myself in learning to code.
