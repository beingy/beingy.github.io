Day 2 was all about git.  So I am going to finish abruptly now and do a git add . + git commit -m "added day 2 partial post" + git push ... and continue the rest of the entry using the github comment field so I can take advantage of their **markdown** feature that is compatible with Jekyll posts.  It'll be really cool if I can make a WYSIWYG blog entry form with markdown formatting tools built-in similar to what github has.. _maybe_ it is shared somewhere already on github... 
list of things to work on:

- [ ] one
- [ ] two
- [ ] three
