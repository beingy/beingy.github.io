title: "Day 12: What I have learned and forgotten..."

I'm wrapping up the CSS/HTML lessons today and tomorrow learning about Bootstrap.  Looking ahead, I'll be starting Procedural Ruby and it dawned on me that I don't remember much of what I learned in Intro to Ruby... doh! I have a feeling that I will remember that I have forgotten a lot of the CSS materials once I get re-acquainted with Ruby.  Maybe it'll be a constant juggle until I do enough of both and other new materials.

# Note to self: #

1. Start reviewing previous lectures via videos and jotting down quick notes or even if it is just the headlines of each section.
2. It is really time to bunker down and brace for intense learning.
