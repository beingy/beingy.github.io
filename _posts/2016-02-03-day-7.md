I'm now inundated with things to learn and videos to watch. I have to constantly remind myself that I need to take it one step at a time.  No sense in rushing through or trying to catch up to others discussing on things way over my head.

In Avi's orientation video, I take it to heart if learning to code is like cheese, be a solid gouda cheese and not swiss cheese filled with pockets of air.  Okay, maybe Avi only mentioned swiss cheese as an example to learn with a great foundation of understanding the material so there isn't pockets of missing knowledge that eventually needed to be course-corrected.  This is a preview to the complexity of Rails and need a solid understand of Ruby.  I just really like gouda cheese.

I think I will need to do some reading to sharpen my Ruby terminologies.  I am an abstract guy that recognize ideas, personalities, images and shapes and usually skim on names and technical terms on things.  I'm really nervous on the eventual technical review to explain my code but at least now I know I will need to prepare myself for it.

Everyone is recommending The Well-Grounded Rubyist as the go-to book.  Check it out: [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617291692).

My daily struggle is still getting my routine down.  It will happen.  I really hope so.
